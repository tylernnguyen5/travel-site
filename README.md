# Travel Site

As I learn more about the industry standards in web development tools, practices and work flow, I wanted to have a project where I can try to put everything together and make them work. 

Therefore, we have this fictional travel website where the users can book their vacation through an application. This is a single-page website for advertising the application.

For the Secret Client Area at the bottom of the page, this is where I implemented a simple example with AWS Lambda Cloud function to send requests and working with the responses received. The secret passphrase is *'javascript'*.

## Live Demo

The application is hosted with **Netlify** and you can have a look at the website [here](https://sad-jones-cae779.netlify.app/).
